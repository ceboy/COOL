poisson

  mixed Dirichlet-Neumann-Periodic BVP for the scalar poisson equation "-Delta u = f"

  solved in various polygonal geometries (also various meshes) with

  data from various analytical solutions and

  essential BC (Dirichlet/Neumann and half-Periodic) imposed by substitution of the corresponding DOF in various conforming variational formulations

  primal (using P1: CG for SPD matrix can be improved by preconditionning),

  primal-mixed (P1-P0^2: undefinite saddle-point equivalent to primal after static condensation can be solved by UMFPACK or GMRES without penalization)

  dual-mixed  (P0-RT0: undefinite saddle-point can be solved by UMFPACK or GMRES without penalization, it is equivalent to non-conforming P1nc)

 PRE:
  * input.idp: mesh, BC (type and value), FE, solver and linalg parameters

 RUN:
  * poisson*.edp: according to the variational formulation of the problem retained

 POST:
  * poisson*.gp: gnuplot script to show *.dat
  * hcv*.edp to read output files and recompute postprocessed values

 TODO:
  * finish non-conforming variational formulations (Crouzeix-Raviart P1nc)
  * add UZAWA for saddle-point, and other linalg routines
  * find a more generic way to match the various formulations and FE spaces together
  * bypass Freefem++ bug: the normal component of RT0 shape functions is not always continuous along faces !
    (this is a problem e.g. when one wants to connect edges with periodic BC, and has to detect compatible dofs)
  * test other implementation of boundary conditions (Lagrange multipliers for essential dofs, elimination for periodic
    ones: now we use one set of equations with glued test functions plus one set requiring equality)
    NB: the order/priority wrto essential BC at intersecting boundaries seems unimportant (?)
